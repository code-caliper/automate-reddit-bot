# Reddit Video Maker Bot 🎥
## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Playwright (this should install automatically in installation)

## Installation 👩‍💻

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run `python -m playwright install` and `python -m playwright install-deps`

**EXPERIMENTAL!!!!**

On MacOS and Linux (debian, arch, fedora and centos, and based on those), you can run an install script that will automatically install steps 1 to 3. (requires bash)

`bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot/master/install.sh)`

This can also be used to update the installation

4. Run `python main.py`
5. Visit [the Reddit Apps page.](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps), and set up an app that is a "script".
6. The bot will ask you to fill in your details to connect to the Reddit API, and configure the bot to your liking
7. Enjoy 😎
8. If you need to reconfigure the bot, simply open the `config.toml` file and delete the lines that need to be changed. On the next run of the bot, it will help you reconfigure those options.

(Note if you got an error installing or running the bot try first rerunning the command with a three after the name e.g. python3 or pip3)
